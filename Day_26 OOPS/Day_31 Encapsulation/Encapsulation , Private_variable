Encapsulation
------------------------------

--> Encapsulation is a one of the Four Fundamentals  Concepts in OOP's  imcluding  Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism

--> Encapsulation is the packing of data and Functions,
    that work on that data within a single Object.

          (( or ))
    Wrapping the data and Methods into single Unit

           (( or ))
     Encapsulation is the building of data and methods that operate on that data , into single Unit

--> You can hide the internal state of the object from the Outside , this is known as Information Hiding

--> A class is a Example of Encapsulation
        A class has a bundle of data and methods into a single unit, and that class provides
        access to its attributes and methods

--> If you have an Attribute , that is not visible to the Outside ,
    but you can control the access to its value ,and your object is always has a valid State

Private Varibales
-------------------------
-------------------------

==> in python , we are using a prefix as an attribute ,
   with a double Underscore to make it private .

==> Private Variable ( Or ) attribute can be only accessible inside the class ,
   in other words , they can't be accessible from outside of the class

    __variableName
    __methodname
