Inheritance
-----------------
Inheritance is the process by which genetic information is passed on from parent to child.


Single level Inheriatnce
Multi level Inheriatnce
Multiple Inheriatnce
Hirarchial Inheritance
Hubrid Iheritance


super class ==> ParentClass ==> Base Class
sub class ==> Child class ==> Derived class

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

Single level Inheriatnce
-----------------------------
In Single level Inheritance the propertise are Extending from Single parent class to single Child Class

One super class related to One Derived Class

parent
  |
 Child

Multi level Inheriatnce
--------------------------
class Grand parent is a Super class , it is  derived from one Sub class parent
Again Super Parent class is derived from one Sub class Child.

class A
  class B(A)
     class C(B)
        class D(C)
           class E(D)

Multiple Inheritance
--------------------
When ever Your Workingwith Multiple iNheritance , n theChild class , we can apply above parent class propertise

In the hild class ,we can applying parent class propertise


Class A     Class B     class C

     Class D(A, B, C)


Hirarchial inheritance
-------------------------
Getting propertise from one  parent class to many child classes is possible whenever your working with Hirarchial INheritance

                     Class A

class B(A)        class C(A)      class D(A)   class E(A)



Hybrid Inheritance
------------------------
this is a Combination of Multilevel and Hyrarchial INheritance

class A
  class B(A)
     class C(B)
        class D(C)
           class E(D)


 and


                      Class A

class B(A)        class C(A)      class D(A)   class E(A)
