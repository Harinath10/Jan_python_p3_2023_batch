Abstraction
===============

--> abstraction is a internal implimentation
--> abstarction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users
--> the users can only interact with the basic implimentation of the Function,
    but inner working is hidden.

--> User is familier with "what function does" , But they "dont know how it does".

Ex:
----
         in simple words , we all are using smart phones, and  very much familier with  its function
         such as Camera , Voice recorder , call dailing etc.
         But we dont know how these operations are happing in the background.
Abstarctmethod
-------------------
   abstract method doesn't have any method declarartion or implimentation

Abstract class
-------------
 A class that consists of one or more abstract method is called the abstract class.
 Abstract methods do not contain their implementation.
 abstract class have some Abstarct methods and some normal methods.

Interface
--------------
interface has all Abstract methods.
( because we can use all functionalities but we dont know internal functionality)


Concrete class or normal class
---------------------------------
concrete class has only normal methods without abstract methods

Abstract Base Classes ==> ABC

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
