Functions
--------------------

==> a function is a block of organised ,reusable code
    that is used to perform a single , related action

==> function is a piece of Code written to carryout a specific task

==> as you know python gives many built-in functions, like
    print(), map(), reduce() etc.

    but you can also create your own functions .these functions are called User_defined_functions

==> function block begins with def keyword followed by  function name and paranthasis and colon.
   we can get the function block of code by using function calling using the function name


=============================================
parameters
===========
        parameters is the varaibles listed inside the paranthasis in the function definition

arguments
==========
       arguments is the value that is sent to the function when it is called


 -->  Information can be passed into functions as arguments
 -->  we can add many arguments but separated by comma

 arbitory Arguments
 ======================
 if we dont know how many arguments that  will be passed into your function ,
 add * before the parameter name in the function definition


Keyword_arguments
===================
 -->   we can also send arguments with key and value Syntax
 -->   This way the order of arguments doesn't matter.

                                       def k_args(name,age,gender):
                                            print("my Age is :", age)     # my Age is : 28
                                       k_args(age=28,name="Amar",gender="MAlE")

 Arbitory Keyword_ arguments
 =============================
 if we dont know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into  your function
  add two asterisk : ** before the parameter in the function defintion

  or

  if the number of keyword arguments is Unknown add a ** before the parameter name
