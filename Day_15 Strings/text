Strings
=====================
While strings themselves are immutable in Python,
 you can still use string methods like replace() to create new strings with modified content.
  When you use replace() or other string manipulation methods,
   Python creates a new string object rather than modifying the original string.

split
----------
the split () method splits a string into a list
we can specify the separator, default separator is any whitespace

join
----------------
the join() method takes all items in an iterables and join them into one string
a string must be specified as the separator
