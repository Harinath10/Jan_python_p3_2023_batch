Lambda Functions 
================
                   --> Lambda Functions are the Single line Functions declared with no name.
                   --> It can have number of arguments , But only one Expression
                   --> Lambda Functions are used in build_in_functions like map(),filter(),reduce()
                   --> lambda functions are called as Ananamous Functions
                   --> Ananamous functions may be a function that defined without a reputation
                   --> a function with has no function name
                   -->Lambda has No return Type
                   --> firstly, the expression is Evaluated and then returned automatically
                   --> we use lambda expressions where_ever function objects required

syntax:
-------------------------------------------------------------
                   Syntax:  lambda arguments: Expression

                     Ex:      result=lambda(a,b:a*b)
                              print(result(10,8)                 # 80





Filter()   
-------------------
      --> filter() can filter the given sequence with the help of function //
                     that tests each element in the sequence to be TRUE or NOT
      --> We must define data type Also

                SYNTAX: filter(function,Sequence)
                   Ex : lst=[1,2,3,4,5]
                        pqr=filter(lambda x:x%2==0,lst)
                        print(list(pqr))             # [2,4]
