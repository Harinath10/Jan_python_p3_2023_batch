jump Statements
====================

Break
----------
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true

continue
------------
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next

pass
-------
==> function definition has or if  statemnets can't be  empty , if you some reason have a function or if or for   with no conetent ,
        put the pass statements to avoid getting an error.

==>  The pass statement is a null statement. But the difference between pass and comment is that comment is ignored by the  interpreter whereas pass is not ignored..
