Set __   Frozen set
_______________________
------------------------

empty_set ==>  set()

--> Set is collection of Data
--> we can denoted as {} --> flower brackets
--> set is Un_ordered
--> set Don't allow Duplicates
--> Set also Homogenious and Hetrogenious
--> index and Slicing not allows
--> Set is Mutable -- changable

    add()  --> we can add Only one Value

    update([])  --> we can add Multiple values

    remove()  --> it can remove the value inside the data
                  ( if we don't have the value inside the set we get the error)

    discard()  --> it can remove the value inside the data
                  ( if we don't have the value inside the set we get No_error and No_Output)



Frozen_set
-------------

--> frozen_Set is collection of Data
--> we can denoted as frozenset{setvalues} --> flower brackets
--> frozenset is Un_ordered
--> frozenset Don't allow Duplicates
--> frozenSet also Homogenious and Hetrogenious
--> index and Slicing not allows
--> frozenset is IM_Mutable -- can't changable

--> frozenset is just like set , but it is Immutable

Ex: x={1,2,3}
    t=frozenset(x)
    print(t)


==> in frozenset we can't go with add(),update(),remove(),discard()
