Copy
--------------------

1) shallo Copy --> only one layer

              A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references to the child objects found in the original.
               In essence, a shallow copy is only one level deep. The copying process does not recurse and therefore won't create copies of the child objects themselves.

2) deep Copy  --> all layers

             In case of deep copy, a copy of object is copied in other object. It means that any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object.
             In python, this is implemented using “deepcopy()” function.
